# -FILE-HANDLING-PROGRAM
COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : SUMEET KUMAR SINGH

INTERN ID : CITS0D732

DOMAIN : C PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR NAME : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

Detailed Description:

In this task, I was required to write a C program that demonstrates the fundamental file operations in C. The primary goal was to showcase the ability to handle files programmatically — creating, reading, writing, and appending — which are essential operations in any system-based or data-driven application.

The program uses standard file I/O functions provided by the C standard library such as:

fopen()

fprintf() / fputs()

fscanf() / fgets()

fclose()


The user can select the operation they want to perform via a simple text-based menu. Based on the input, the file operation is executed accordingly.



Tools and Support Used:

ChatGPT: Helped me understand the structure and logic of file I/O in C. Also helped debug and optimize my code with explanations of functions like fopen() modes ("w", "a", "r+").

YouTube: I referred to multiple beginner-friendly tutorials on file handling. Visual explanations and code walkthroughs made it easier to grasp how to read and append without data loss.

Grok Learning AI: Assisted me with interactive C programming practice and provided a safe environment to test small file handling snippets before finalizing the complete program.



Applications of File Handling:

Data Storage: File handling allows storing data persistently, even after the program terminates.

Log Files: Many applications use file handling to write logs and debug information.

Configuration Management: Programs often store settings and preferences in config files.

Database Systems: Basic file handling forms the foundation for custom flat-file databases.

Report Generation: Data can be extracted from a program and exported into text files.


Challenges Faced:

File Mode Confusion: Initially confused between different fopen modes like "w", "a", "r+". Solved this using ChatGPT and documentation.

Data Overwriting: While testing write operations, I accidentally overwrote the entire file contents. Later learned how to safely append using "a" mode.

EOF Handling: Faced issues while reading files until end-of-file (EOF). Learned about using feof() and reading line by line using fgets().

Cross-Platform Testing: Output file paths behaved differently on Linux vs. Windows systems. Had to make the code portable using relative paths.


Conclusion:

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of file operations in C — a fundamental skill for any systems programmer. I gained hands-on experience in reading/writing real-world data, debugging logical errors, and making my program more user-interactive. Thanks to the support from ChatGPT, YouTube tutorials, and Grok AI, I was able to complete the task effectively and confidently.
